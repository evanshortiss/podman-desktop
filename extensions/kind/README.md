# Kind extension

This extension adds the support of [https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/](Kind).

By using this extension, it is possible to create Kubernetes clusters
running on top of the container engine. Note that installing `kind` binary
is a prerequisite to using the Kind extension.

You can initialize a kind cluster using the Resources section in Settings
once the `kind` binary is installed on your machine.
